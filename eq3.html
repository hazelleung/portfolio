                    <h3>Designing an interdisciplinary research journal that features research done by undergraduates of Earl Warren College at UC San Diego.</h3>
                    <p>The Equilibrium is a student organization that annually publishes a research journal filled with research done by undergraduates in the Earl Warren college. This project covers the design work done for the third edition of the journal, published in summer of 2017.</p>

                <p>The Equilibrium is a relatively new organization, and because of this, branding and design has been inconsistent and experimental. For this issue, we wanted to make the journal more professional, coherent, and consistent. Since The Equilibrium is an interdisciplinary research journal, a particular challenge was presented: How do we create an effective page layout that clearly showcases, represents, and supports all types of research, regardless of the research field.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>In order to gauge what features users enjoyed or were confused by, user interviews were conducted. Questions were asked to evaluate the effectiveness of a design choice. Questions included, but were not limited to: "What is your initial response to the journal?" "Were there moments/pages where you found it hard to read/understand?" "What is one aspect that you would improve?"</p>
                <p>I used these interviews to frame and contextualize the design choices for the new issue of the journal. From the interviews, I gathered that <span> a major challege was creating a uniform presentation, especially within the a single journal issue itself.</span> Major points were to standardize the page frames, color used, and page layouts for easier readability.</p>

                <p><span>Finding a clean design that was versatile and able to accomodate different types of research was particularly challenging and interesting.</span> Since some research submissions are more visual based (photos, graphs, and tables), the layout had to be able to include essential figures while also be adaptable to those that did not have many figures. Choosing the two column format allowed images to be interspersed within the text and provided visual detail that preemptively prevents articles from becoming large blocks of text.
