                    <h3>Creating the internal, admin version of NPR's third-party and local station podcast management tool.</h3>
                    <p>When a NPR employee who works with non-NPR podcasts, they want a space where they can both get both the high-level view of the full portfolio and be able to drill down into a specific episode on a show.</p>

                    <p>THE TEAM</p>
                    <p>I worked with a scrum team comprised of a product manager, a project manager, software developers, a QA engineer, and an engineering manager.</p>

                    <p>THE METHODOLOGY & TOOLS</p>
                    <p>I was the only designer on this project, handling all things from designing/facilitating workshops to wireframing/prototyping in Figma.</p>

                <p>In addition to podcasts that NPR produces, NPR also distributes podcasts from member stations and other third-party podcasters in NPR-owned-and-operated clients (like the NPR One mobile application and the website). This is done via podcast RSS feed ingestion.</p>
            
                <p>After the completion of Station and Third-party Podcast Management Discovery project, we had a tool to build: Podcasters NPR Dashboard (PaNDa). This tool would be both internally and externally facing.</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><span>NPR Staff:</span> admin view of all station and third-party podcasts in a centralized location where they can view, manage, and troubleshoot these podcasts</li>
                    <li><span>Local Station Staff & Third-party Podcasters:</span> view and manage their podcasts that are in the NPR database</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This portfolio piece is specifically only on the internal version of this tool that NPR staff will utilize.</p>

                        <p>There are also podcasts that come from public-media adjacent organizations like America Public Media (APM) and Public Radio Exchange (PRX). For the purpose of this portfolio piece, I am also referring to this type of podcasts as “Station podcasts.”</p>

                <p>These sessions were facilitated over remote video calls, and utilized Google Slides as the central collaboration tool. Sessions first had an individual ideation section, where they would brainstorm ideas for what this tool would look like and/or account for. Then we came back together for a group discussion before working together to create a single low-fidelity UI wireframe that took everyone’s main ideas into consideration. We did this twice: once for a dashboard page and once for a podcast page.</p>

                <p>In the start of 2021, a bigger, newer project was brought forward from the NPR Board and C-suite executives: NPR+, a premium podcast offering where listeners can listen to ad-free NPR podcasts. In order to work on this, many on my team (including myself as the sole designer on all podcast tech at NPR) were asked to pivot as quickly as possible. </p>
                <p>As a result, we were tasked wrap up work on PaNDa as quickly as possible. We 1) cut the scope of this initiative down to just the internal version of this tool to accomplish this (i.e. we were not going to create an externally facing side of this tool, as outlined in the local station and third-party management discovery project) and 2) we cut functionality of the internal version down to just be an improved troubleshooting tool that provided more detailed descriptions of warnings and errors.</p>

                <p>For improved troubleshooting, the project’s lead software developer and I went through the different kinds of RSS feed issues that could arise. We categorized them into two buckets: warnings and errors. Warnings are issues that do not prevent a podcast from being ingested and utilized on NPR platforms. Errors are issues that do prevent a podcast from being ingested and must be fixed before it can be utilized on NPR platforms. </p>
                <p>After categorization, I grouped similar issues together. Similarity was based on the action(s) that would be required to resolve the issue. With these groupings, I wrote a summary of the issue for display in the UI. I then brought these groupings and messages to the OnlineTech digital support team to review and provide their thoughts on how these groupings or messages could be improved.</p>

                        <p>For the dashboard, I proceeded with the row design because it provided an easier experience scanning the status of podcasts down the left-hand side.</p>
                        <p>One of the most common use cases for internal NPR staff is to ascertain the status of a podcast and to troubleshoot a reported issue. The left-hand status column best supports the experience of quick scanning in one direction.</p>
                        <p>However, we also removed the “add podcast” functionality to cut implementation scope as it required complex organization associations that new back-end services were not built to handle yet. </p>

                    <div class="text">
                        <h3 class="green">Error Handling and Experiences</h3>
                        <p>I also expanded error handling experiences to capture more use cases.</p>
                        <p>For example, RSS feed URLs must be unique and not match any other podcast in the NPR catalogue. The feed ingestion service will validate data entries and the Podcasters NPR Dashboard will display the corresponding error message, if needed.</p>
                        <p>Other use cases included when the URL was not a valid one, did not use https, or when PaNDa runs into difficulties performing an action from a button click.</p>

                <p>The podcast page designs had a status bar at the top of the page that showed whether a podcast state was good, warning, error, inactive, or invisible. In this iteration, I removed the status bar because 1) good is the default state, 2) it was redundant to have the state and warning/error bars, and 3) inactive and invisible statues should be more obvious.</p>

                <p>Like in most places, the COVID-19 pandemic was something that really threw a wrench into our plans. But, things happen, and I very quickly learned how to adapt and pivot to finding smaller, quicker wins. The larger station and third-party management tool we envisioned in the discovery project would have not only could have been a huge UX improvement for internal NPR staff, local station staff, and third-party podcasters, but could have been a huge business opportunity for NPR as well.</p>
                <p>NPR and local radio stations are ultimately all a part of the public media radio network where we interdepend on one another. Making the lives of those at local stations, which are oftentimes very small and severely understaffed, easier makes the lives of NPR staff easier as well. However, the perfect should not get in the way of good. This version of PaNDa that we implemented is successful, even if it is a smaller improvement.</p>
