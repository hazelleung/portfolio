                <p>The NPR Network is a collaborative journalism effort between NPR and the 250 member local Stations across the United States. The goal of the NPR Network is to create a unique national and local blend of journalism by enabling collaboration between a more national organization (NPR) and a more local organization (Stations). This national/local blend of journalism delivers quality and extremely relevant news to local communities. </p>
                <p> CDS is NPR’s proprietary content delivery API for the NPR Network, meant to enable a seamless exchange of journalism across participating organizations. </p>
                <p>To start small, we scoped this project to an internal NPR release, with a future goal to release this tool to the broader NPR Network (i.e. local stations). </p>

                <p>CDS is a relatively new API, with NPR clients being the heaviest users and Stations slowly onboarding onto, publishing to, and reading from it. Consequently, not much was known about how CDS users behave, what their goals are, and how they wish to use CDS to achieve their goals. These workshops were many people’s first time giving customer feedback to us.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 40px">Since I was designing a 0-1 product, everything was greenspace. Using the design system I had previously set up, below are a few main features I focused on.</p>

            <h3 class="green">Querying CDS — understanding what is in CDS and making it easier to find items</h3>
            <p>The biggest paint point people felt was not understanding what was in CDS. To address this, I created a modular homepage that displays the most popular collections in CDS and the most recently published content to CDS. This helps with discoverability.</p>
            <p>Additionally, a search and filter bar at the top helps users build a query, which is a huge change from requiring someone to know how to build their own query using accepted parameters.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>I played with different ways to display metadata of different types of content. Each content type can have different variations of metadata, making a design with a modular approach the most efficient.</p>
            
            <hr>

            <h3 class="green">Search Results Cards - Speed up troubleshooting publishing issues</h3>
            <p>These cards are what are displayed after someone performs a search. Intended to be a quick snapshot of the CDS document, it surfaces the key information about a piece of content and the most important information needed for someone to quickly troubleshoot. A more detailed view can be accessed by clicking into a card. I worked through various iterations, playing with the what kind of metadata is shown and how the metadata is shown.</p>

            <h3 class="green">CDS Documents & Document Assets - Understand what metadata is in CDS</h3>
            <p>There are ~30 different type of asset types in CDS, and each type has a different variation of metadata (e.g. text, audio, images, videos, links, etc). This presents a difficult design challenge to find a design that accommodates for all possible permutations. With the assumption that I will cover most, and most common, use cases, I came up with these initial designs based on the most frequently used asset types for all content published between a time period of one month.</p>
            <div class="module-blocks">
                <div data-aos="fade-right" data-aos-once="true">
                    <img src="../images/projects/concierge/asset1.png" class="img">

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>However, after some review with the engineering team, it became clear that these initial designs I created for CDS assets was not enough for an engineer to take action on them. Ultimately, I needed to design a more modular display in order to encompass all the different kinds of assets there were and the variations how assets can show up in a single document/piece of content. I ideated new variations to find a  better solution that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Strike a balance between necessary information and detailed information via previews with expandable/collapsible capabilities</li>
                <li>Showcase the hierarchy of metadata within a single asset via better groupings and top-level labeling of IDs</li>
                <li>More clearly distinguishing between variations of a single asset (i.e. one asset ID) and multiple assets with different variations (i.e. multiple asset IDs)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Concierge launched with much fanfare. It solved a lot of pain points that people at NPR had, particularly having to do with finding content within CDS (newsroom division) and troubleshooting issues that local stations raise (on-call software engineers and member partnership division).</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Visibility into reporting on major news events (e.g. elections, major weather events, the Olympics, etc.) was faster and less manual, allowing reporters to focus on the news instead of manipulating tools to find what they needed.</li>
                <li>Streamlined troubleshooting of content display issues (e.g. incorrect images, wrong audio, different title being pulled, etc.) in half by removing the need for an engineer to query CDS.</li>
