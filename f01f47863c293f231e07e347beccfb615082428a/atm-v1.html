                    <h3>ATM is a standalone tool for podcast producers to easily mark and preview their podcast episodes for dynamic sponsorship.</h3>
                    <p>Podcast sponsorship is a NPR revenue powerhouse that was projected (pre-pandemic) to contribute $55 million in revenue in fiscal 2020. Of podcast sponsorship, dynamic midroll sponsorship, which has the greatest projection for growth, contributes close to $17 million annually.</p>

                    <p>THE TEAM</p>
                    <p>I worked with a multidisciplinary group of people comprised of a product manager, a project manager, software developers, a QA engineer, and an audio production subject matter expert.</p>

                    <p>THE METHODOLOGY & TOOLS</p>
                    <p>As the sole designer on this project, I handled all things design, from conducting user research to creating mockups and prototypes in Figma.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>The original tool used to mark episodes for sponsorship had limited capabilities and was part of the larger NPR content management system (CMS), which is being sunsetted for a new CMS. As such, this provided an opportunity to improve a tool that was a major source of annual revenue and to expand the tool's capabilities to serve more needs.</p>
            
                <p>This project was a cross-divisional effort that spanned across the core software development team in the Digital Media department, the podcast ad operations team in National Public Media (NPM, NPR's corporate sponsorship organization), and podcast producers in the News/Programming department. It also included technical collaboration with our third-party sponsorship vendor, AdsWizz.</p>
            
                <p>Creating this new tool solved problems for producers and for NPM in two ways:</p>
    
                <ol>
                    <li>Improve workflow steps related to podcast sponsorship for podcast producers, who handle creating episodes and inserting sponsorship messages.</li>
                    <li>Provide flexibility of sponsorship products for NPM, who handles all sponsorship sales and navigates a constantly fluctuating advertisement market.</li>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>Before I joined the project, a contractor team built a proof of concept version based on specs that were meant for a similar, but generally different use case. The tech stack for the prototype tool was the basis for ATM.</p>

                <p>With a fully-functional prototype tool, I started with conducting usability testing to get an understanding of what the prototype tool does well and what it does not. Here are the high-level findings:</p>

                    <h3 class="green">1. Language usage</h3> 
                    <p class="spacing">There was a mismatch between the language that the prototype tool used and podcast production teams used.</p>
                    <p class="quote-text">"I've never heard of 'event' before and have no idea what it's supposed to be."</p>

                    <p class="spacing">There was a lack of feedback when something was marked, leaving producers unknowing if they successfully marked their episode correctly or not.</p>
                    <p class="quote-text">"Did it work? How do I know if it did or didn't? I guess there's a line in the waveform now."</p>

                    <p class="spacing">Producers work with very specific timecues and often need to mark places to the millisecond.</p>
                    <p class="quote-text">"Oh this is going to be very annoying if I have to always type the colons for my timecues. It's going to be very easy to get wrong."</p>

            <p>With the information from the prototype usability testing, I made the following design updates:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Made the preview functionality more explicit by moving it above the original play button and by updating the copy to “Play with Sponsorship” to delineate exactly what the button does.</li>
                <li>Maintained the use of the word “Publishing” because updates made here will be instantaneously applied to the audio file in the database, meaning edits will be published without a manual re-publishing in our CMS.</li>

This digital support center holds resources with previously held ATM trainings, documentation with explanations, and answers to common questions. Additionally, it was a place where producers could easily submit a help ticket to our dedicated technical support staff without relying on email and personal connections.</p>

            <p>ATM proved to be a huge improvement to producers for several reasons. First, ATM provided visibility into the tagging process; previously, producers were only entering timecodes into a system that spit back another audio file for them. With ATM, producers had more control into exactly where they wanted to mark their breaks and the ability to quickly return to making edits after performing quality control checks. Second, it simplified required steps. Instead of keeping track of the multiple audio file URLs that the old system took and created, there was only one. Additionally, producers were able to switch out old sponsorship tags for new ones by just changing the ad product in ATM instead of retagging the whole episode. Finally, it was just a much better visual UI. The previous tool was extremely minimal and was only supposed to be a prototype, not a final product that looked like a form from the 1990s.</p>
            <p>Here are some quotes from producers after we released ATM V1:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>“That is fantastic. Great. Great. So many things about this is great.”</li>
                <li>“Oh my god clearly my mind is blown. What do you mean there’s no new URL. Amazing.”</li>
                <li>“This is so much better!!”</li>
                <li>“Really appreciate that you don’t have to put in punctuation for timecodes.”</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Podcast production is an entire craft that lives in the audio production/journalism industry, one that I — at the time of starting on ATM — was very unfamiliar with. ATM was the very first project I worked on at NPR (in fact, I was thrown into a day-long, initial project planning session for ATM right after my company orientation days!). As a result, I had to quickly get myself up to speed on podcast production, the sponsorship advertisement industry, how design worked at NPR, and the intersections of all of these.</p>
            <p>If I were to go back and do this project again, I would ask even more questions. Originally, we centered ATM's design only on podcast producers. However, during the design phase, there was a small, but key, group of colleagues that was being on-boarded to be part of the support team. As a result, there was a group of secondary users who we hadn't considered when creating ATM, leading to growing pains for that support team as they learned how to use ATM and lengthened support time.</p>
            <p>I also learned about how to create designs that compromise with third-party vendor and implementation dependencies (e.g. instead of a live preview that sounds exactly like it would to a listener, example placeholder sponsorship was played in the preview). Quite a few of the prototype designs we wanted to implement for our podcast producers ended up being scrapped because we were dependent on AdsWizz for preview generation.</p>
