                    <h3>FIS is a backend service that powers the front-end experience of externally produced podcasts on NPR platforms.</h3>
                    <p>In addition to owned and operated podcasts, NPR also distributes podcasts produced by third-parties. As a result, NPR needs a way to view, manage, and troubleshoot these kinds of podcasts and their RSS feeds.</p>

                    <p>THE TEAM</p>
                    <p>This team comprised of myself as the only designer, a product manager, two software engineers, a QA engineer, and an engineering manager.</p>

                    <p>THE METHODOLOGY & TOOLS</p>
                    <p>Since this was a discovery effort, I made an effort to use research and collaborative workshops as much as possible. I conducted standard user research studies and designed/facilitated custom workshops. I then created workflows and service design diagrams in Figma.</p>

            </div>
            
            <div class="section-content">
                 <p>There were approximately 3,000 non-NPR podcasts from around 650 local network stations and other third-party publishers that NPR distributes audio content for on NPR platforms like NPR.org and NPR One mobile app. This is accomplished via podcast RSS feed ingestion, which means the publisher creates a RSS feed and provides the link to the RSS feed to NPR for NPR to process and utilize.</p>
            
                <p>Establishing a way of ingesting, storing, and playing these podcasts and episodes was an important effort. In the NPR One app alone, local network station and third-party podcasts account for 1.8 hours and 2.5 hours of listening per user, respectively. Additionally, for local network stations, NPR One accounts for 29% of their podcast downloads, making it a key source of podcast engagement for them.</p>
            
                <p>The tool that previously ingested 3rd-party RSS feeds lived inside NPR's old CMS. Since NPR is currently in the process of sunsetting the old CMS for a newer one, we had an opportunity to take apart the old tool, improve workflows, and expand tool functionality to better serve the needs of the people who need to use it.</p>

In order to solve it, the NPR One Editorial team had to submit a support ticket to the OnlineTech team.

                <p>A major update to the status quo, I designed self-troubleshooting for station and third-party podcasters. With about 2,500 podcasts that can potentially be incorrectly ingested, internal NPR teams spent a lot of time responding to requests and issues from external podcasters. With this new design, station and third-party podcasters will gain visibility into their podcasts in NPR systems and self-troubleshoot issues before escalating to someone at NPR.</p>

                <p>I also outlined workflow pathways for how major actions like adding a podcast to NPR systems would happen, depending on who you are. If you are someone at NPR, you can directly add a podcast to the station/third-party podcast directory and the station/third-party will be able to see it in their account dashboard.</p>

                <p>At the same time, if a station or third-party podcaster adds a podcast themselves, the podcast will go to a review stage, where the editorial team at NPR will review and approve or deny the addition of the podcast. </p>

                    <p>Most podcast issues are issues that our internal teams are not able to resolve because they are not the owners of the podcast RSS feed. The stations and third-parties are! Thus, podcast management and troubleshooting took up a lot of coordination and communication with people outside the organization, which takes up a lot of time.</p>

            <p>We could have continued with discovery, but at some point we needed to make decisions and start shaping the solution we wanted to implement. So, with all the information we learned during our discovery project, we came up with a solution: create a tool that is both externally and internally facing. Externally, third-party podcasters and member stations would be able to manage and troubleshoot their podcasts in the tool. This would lift the burden off of the people at NPR who interface with third-party podcasters and member station staff. Internally, the tool would provide an admin-level view of all third-party and station podcasts that had been entered into NPR systems.</p>
            
            <p>Find out more about how we built out that solution and about my process of designing the tool in <span><a href="panda" target="_blank">my portfolio piece on the internal version of FIS/Podcast Producers NPR Dashboard (PaNDa).</a></span></p>

        <p>This was the first multi-sprint discovery I had participated in, and I took it as an opportunity to really insert human-centered design principles to provide strategy direction. When we first started this discovery effort, we only had a general problem space. The sky was the limit; this was both daunting and freeing. I had endless opportunities and paths to take, but a limited time to make choices. So, I let research help guide the way. Use research as the starting point for answering questions and centering the people who would be most affected by the end result in the process. Let their experiences and knowledge guide the direction of the project. And if there were more questions (and of course there were), continue asking and building clarity around the problem and path to a solution.</p>
