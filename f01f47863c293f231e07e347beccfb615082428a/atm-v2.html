                    <h3>A feature update to ATM to automatically update baked-in sponsorship to dynamic sponsorship.</h3>
                    <p>When episodes are initially produced, they have ads within the audio file itself. 28 days after publish, when the contract with that sponsor expires, that ad needs to be replaced in order to continue generating revenue.</p>

                <div class="intro-team">
                    <p>THE TEAM</p>
                    <p>I worked with a small team of developers, a QA engineer, and an ad operations manager as a subject matter expert. We did not have a dedicated product manager because our team's PM just left NPR.</p>
                    <p>So, in addition to being the desginer, I acted as the internal, NPR-facing product manager, gathering requirements, prioritizing requests, coordinating cross-divisional conversations, and organizing feature launch. A lead software developer filled in as the external-facing PM (primarily as the point of contact for ad server AdsWizz).</p>

                <div class="intro-tools">
                    <p>THE METHODOLOGY & TOOLS</p>
                    <p>For design work, I used Figma to create mockups and prototypes.</p>
                    <p>For the more product management work, I would write, update, and distribute product briefs, create diagrams for alignment, and participate in stakeholder conversations.</p>

            <div class="section-content">
                <p>The first time a podcast episode is published, there are segments of sponsorship audio that produced with the rest of the audio file. These sponsorship audio segments are only held for 28 days. After 28 days, they need to be replaced in order to continue monitizing the sponsorship slot within the episode.</p>
                
                <p>This replacement process is an extremely manual one. Podcast producers need to keep track of when 28 days has passed and then retag episodes a second time in ATM. This has resulted in delays and mistakes in moving podcast episodes from using baked-in sponsorship to dynamic midroll sponsorship. In turn, this creates an unstable, unreliable sponsorship inventory, which ultimately costs NPR approximately $50,000+ in monthly revenue.</p>

                <p>There are two types of dynamic midrolls:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Inserted at a specified start time cue ("Insert")</li>
                    <li>Replaces audio between specified start and an end time cues (“Replacement")</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The latter "Replacement" method is the technology that enables replacing baked-in sponsorship messages with dynamic midrolls. Producers specify where their baked-in message (which is produced into the audio file) starts and ends, and based on that information, AdsWizz (our ad server vendor) removes the baked-in message and puts dynamic midroll sponsorship in its place.</p>

                <p>I reviewed these high-fidelity wireframes, with my scrum development team (who could provide development feedback) and with an NPM subject matter expert (who could provide sponsorship business feedback). During these reviews, we realized that the original set of ad product had technical specifications (which were set by AdsWizz) that resulted in a roundabout tagging experience.</p>
                <p>Producers were utilizing the “Replacement” method but by specifying start and end times that were half a second of silence apart. As a result, I proposed a more straightforward tagging experience: producers only need to input a start and end time if they are trying to cover a baked-in sponsorship message. For everything else, producers will use the “Insert” method and only input a start time. This streamlined and freed up the tagging experience to allow for an automatic conversion. </p>

                        <h3>Trainings</h3>
                        <p>Podcast production teams are constantly changing as new producers and/or interns join, leave, and swap teams. As such, a key UX consideration for ATM is new feature training. I collaborated with the team to create producer training for this new feature. We required at least one producer from each podcast to attend the training to learn how to use this automatic baked-in conversion feature.</p>

                <h3>Post-launch Office Hours</h3>
                <p>Additionally, we held three office hour sessions after we launched this feature. Here, producers could come get help with an issue they had while using ATM, tag an episode with us to make sure they were doing it correctly, or ask any questions they might have.</p>

                <p>Since the launch of this feature, we have seen three main benefits:</p>
            
                <ol>
                    <li>NPR/NPM have been able to maximize sponsorship sales, bringing in an additional ~$50,000 a month in revenue to NPR.</li>
                    <li>Podcast producers have fewer steps/tasks to do and keep track of, reducing insertion errors due to manual steps and freeing up time for creating new episodes.</li>
                    <li>Podcast Operations team know exactly where all baked-in sponsorship messages are so they can remove them and create sponsorship-free versions of episodes for NPR Plus distribution (NPR’s paid subscription service).</li>

                <p>This was the first project where I took on not just the design work but also an additional product management feature prioritization and stakeholder management role, specifically on sponsorship requirements with NPM and on feature launch with NPM and Programming podcast production teams. </p>
                <p>It was a great learning experience; I learned how to better communicate with people who are not also in the tech space, and I learned how to tightly scope problems and design solutions into shippable units of work. Smaller, achievable improvements that people are able to benefit from are much better design solutions than trying to design bigger, perfect improvements that never see the light of day. At the same time, losing a team member in the middle of the project really highlighted the importance of every single person on the team and the importance of having developer, design, and product perspectives all present in a scrum implementation team.</p>
