                <p>Network Junction’s previous iteration (Podcasters NPR Dashboard) was limited to just podcasts and only available to NPR staff, limiting Stations’ ability to understand how their podcasts are performing and limiting their ability to troubleshoot any issues.</p>
            
                <p>For many local stations, NPR platforms (particularly the NPR App) is where they receive a bulk of their podcast and newscast listening metrics. Yet, the process of submitting their content to NPR was a black box and error-prone.</p>
            
                <p>We saw this as an opportunity to create a new and improved version that both NPR and at Stations could use as a self-service dashboard. Network Junction is largely the front end experience for the Feed Ingest Service (or FIS) that ingests Station content into the Content Distribution Service (or CDS).</p>

                <p>I first conducted user research to better understand what Station staff need from a podcast and newscast management tool. The original tool (Podcasters NPR Dashboard) was an internal NPR tool that was designed for only NPR staff users in mind. </p>
                <p>I interviewed 13 people from 10 local stations across the continental US. The people we spoke with were those who manage their podcasts and/or newscasts in some capacity (some local stations had one person doing both, others had dedicated staff for each).</p>

            <p>I started with the new designs for sections related to newscast since it would be a brand new addition to Network Junction.</p>
            
            <h3 class="green" style="margin-top:40px">Newscast Dashboard</h3>
            <p>This would be the homepage for anything that has to do with newscasts. A tricky element I had to solve for when designing this dashboard was the consideration of both NPR and local Station views. Someone at NPR would see a more "admin" level view with all newscasts published from all local Stations in the NPR Network. Meanwhile, someone at a Station would only see their content and any content that is shared with them. Due to engineering capacity constraints, the differences between the two had to be minimal.</p>

            <p>This information is what is mostly used to quickly ascertain the status of the content and where in the processing workflow it went wrong. I designed statuses and progress step bars were used to communicate key details needed for troubleshooting, while including more detailed information in deeper pages.</p>

            <h3 class="green">Pivot to Include "Story Segments" Feature</h3>
            <p>During the design process and a shift of priority on another team handling the sunset of StationConnect (a legacy local Station-facing tool), we had to pivot to include an additional feature related to story segments (i.e. short headline-like news pieces that are specifically set to be shared across the NPR Network and pulled into the NPR app). Due to our limited runway before launch, we opted to do a nearly 1:1 design of what was previously available into Network Junction. Minor updates included using the designated NPR Network Tool design system and updated language to match newer technology.</p>
            <div class="module-blocks">
                <div data-aos="fade-in" data-aos-once="true">

                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Throughout these iterations, I solicited feedback from my design team, my scrum team (PM, engineers), and our subject matter experts on the NPR editorial team and NPR member partnership team. From these sessions, we decided that we had to cut down on the number of steps for newscast — the backend endpoint needed to return the different statuses in the designs did not exist and lived in another team’s portfolio. As a result, I simplified the designs to something that was in scope for the dev team but still useful to Station staff.</p>

            <p>After launch, we nearly immediately saw that Network Junction was a success. We measured this in three ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Saw an ~300% increase in Station podcast pitches to the NPR editorial team (more local Station content is reaching more people via NPR’s more national audience)</li>
                <li>A ~30% decrease in Station submitted support ticket to NPR member partnership team (Stations are able to self-service issues with improved transparency/messaging and UX guardrails)</li>
                <li>A 200% faster troubleshooting process for submitted support tickets (NPR member partnership team is spending less time digging for information and can resolve issues themselves via Network Junction UI)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We also received messages lauding our tool and our efforts in including everyone in the design process. </p>
